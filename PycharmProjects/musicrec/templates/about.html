    <h1><font size="3">According to Statista, 69% of the surveyed Americans
        listen to music every day. (Music listening frequency in the United States
        as of August 2017, by age) The new report released by Nielsen Music showed
        that on average, Americans now spend more than 32 hours a week listening
        to music, which is a significant growth, compared to the average of 26.6
        hours in 2016.  While the market for music is growing rapidly, music is
        easier to access than ever, thanks to streaming platforms like Spotify,
        YouTube, etc. Music is played everywhere: in stores, restaurants, and peopleâ€™s
        cars and mobile devices. Therefore, it is not surprising that many music lovers
        get tired of tracks easily and crave for new tracks that fit their taste.</font></h1>
    <h2><font size="3">However, the current way applications such as Spotify or iTunes find music is based
        mainly off of overlapping song interests between users, sentiment analysis, and audio model.
        This way frequently leads to unhelpful recommendations due to over generalization. Therefore,
        our Music Recommendation website is, thus, designed to find the most suitable music to you
        based on the tags of the songs you enter. In this way, we hope to create the personalized playlist
        only for you.</font></h2>
